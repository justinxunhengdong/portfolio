<h1>G'day - I'm Justin!</h1>

<p>I'm a game designer based in Brisbane, Australia. Welcome to my portfolio!
</p>

<p>Professionally, I've worked as a game designer on VR, PC and mobile,
  and usually end up working on systems, technical, UX or level design - and will
  hungrily grab at the chance to work on the bizarre, untested, or unknown.
</p>

<p>
  When I'm not obsessing over the perfect spreadsheet, the correct size of a virtual object, or the relative speeds of different
  projectiles, I can be found writing Letterboxd reviews, watching local theatre, or painting. And playing video games, of course.
