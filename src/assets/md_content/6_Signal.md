_An "opening sequence" that I created for this project in Premiere Pro and After Effects. Signal's colour palette is defined by overgrown weeds, concrete and overcast skies, so I edited each shot to change the colour of the sky from blue to grey._

# Premise
Signal was a transmedia franchise planned for a University of Queensland Multimedia course. It was one of the most highly successful projects in the course, and was showcased for a "best in class" presentation.

Signal revolves around the discovery and decoding of messages from an alternate history post-apocalyptic setting, where the Soviet Union causes a catastrophic accident that isolates a large part of Russia from the rest of the world. The story evolves in parallel; one storyline details the political machinations that lead up to the collapse, and the other details the fallout and coverup of Moscow a century after its collapse.

Signal was unique in that most post-apocalyptic media is told set in a western setting, and in contrast, Signal explores how a post-apocalyptic society would function under a secretive, cold war era government like the Soviet Union. As such, many of Signal's themes concern information, surveillance and politics, which are themes that are not often seen in post-apocalyptic fiction.

## Development

For this project, my contributions involved the direction of the franchise, as well as the planning of its media. As a transmedia franchise, the Signal "experience" consisted not only of the TV show, but an in-universe diary, viral advertisement campaign, and cryptic TV shorts, to be released on Youtube between each episode. The aim of this was to cement Signal in the cultural consciousness as more than just a TV show, as shows such as _Game of Thrones_ and _Breaking Bad_ have. I contributed to two valuable pieces of media for this project, including an opening sequence and concept art, which defined the tone and palette of the franchise.

## Insights

While this project was quite divorced from my typical Information Technology work, I used the course as opportunity to work on many of my other skills, and to explore the creative process within a team. I also enjoyed creating and planning a franchise from scratch, as it was an interesting creative challenge.
