# ATO Online
## A website used by over 10 million Australians.

## Introduction
As part of my work at the Australian Taxation Office as a full-time application developer, I have been able to work on the organisation's primary interface, known as ATO Online, doing development work on its single-page applications. This experience has given me much experience in developing for the web, as well as exposed me to many new topics.

## Development

I worked on many of ATO Online's front-facing features, such as Income Tax History, Tax Accounts and Activity Statements, writing Javascript in the Durandal single-page application framework and unit tests using the Jasmine.js testing framework. I also conducted functional testing, which included accessibility, compatibility and regression tests. I also wrote automated regression tests in C# using the Selenium framework, as well as conducted data setup to mock the many specific scenarios for given features. Aside from this, I function as a proxy Scrum master, leading and assisting team meetings, and my team's UX champion, ensuring that work fits within the established standards and patterns.

## Insights

As a "co-op", my work is more than just development, testing or design; it is multidisciplinary, and I've had the opportunity to work within many new subject areas. As a User Experience degree is not heavily technology-focused, I have been able to polish and practice my development skills while learning to work and communicate in a large organisation spanning several offices and states.
