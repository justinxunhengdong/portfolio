# ATO Online
## A website used by over 10 million Australians.

## Introduction
I worked at the Australian Taxation Office as a part-time undergraduate and for a period of time following my graduation. Within this time, I learnt many skills surrounding testing, development and management for a large company. During my time there I was able to fill a multidisciplanary role, starting off as a front-end developer, moving to a systems analyst, then onto managerial roles as the team's Scrum Master. I was also given responsibility as a designer of a large feature, where I was the primary business analyst and team liason, as well as its UX designer. I was also a UX and agile evangelist within my team.

## Development

I worked on many of ATO Online's front-facing applications, such as Income Tax History, Agent Reports and Activity Statements, writing Javascript in the Durandal single-page application framework and unit tests using the Jasmine.js testing framework. I also conducted functional testing, which included accessibility, compatibility and regression tests. I also wrote automated regression tests in C# using the Selenium framework, as well as conducted data setup to mock the many specific scenarios for given features.  

At the ATO, I have worked as an interface designer, prototyping different scenarios in Sketch or XD. I found this a challenge, particularly since my skills are more geared towards user research and UX architecture; my experience in interface design was comparatively lesser.  

## PAYGW Variation Application

My largest piece of work involved the conversion of a complex paper form into an accessible format for ATO Online. This feature is known as PAYG Withholding Variation Application, and is a stripped-down version of MyTax.

My initial work involved breaking down the existing paper form and understanding each question from a business rules perspective. My goal with this was to understand the information architecture of the form. To do this, I physically printed out the paper form, and split it up into each question and text box. I then reorganised these based on an overall flow of the document, and liased with the business team to verify its functionality.

From here I designed the page in Adobe XD and Sketch. As this was during a transitionary period at the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, we had compatibility issues between each program that hindered my work. We were luckily able to push past these issues, and I used the existing established ATO design patterns and components to build the page, communicating frequently with the UX team to ensure that the patterns were being followed, and the page was cohesive with the rest of the website. I learnt much about interface design during this stage, as my previous work mainly surrounded the social/psychological side of UX design. Unfortunately, we were not able to do genuine user testing, which is standard within the UX space - we worked mostly off previous insights and guidance from the UX team.

As a result of my knowledge designing the page and refining its rules, wordings and interactions, I became the primary business analyst for this feature within my team. I had to write detailed documentation and was given the responsibility of collating and understanding detailled business rules and interactions, and negotiated, suggested and championed alternatives with both business stakeholders and UX consultants. As one of the first instances at the ATO where design, business and development happened concurrently, we had to adapt quickly to an agile development process (the ATO follows a waterfall process with regards to business and design of pages). I had to tightly communicate with my team's developers, ensuring that the right decisions were being made early, keeping in mind team capacity, velocity and estimations. I was able to organise our workflows and mitigate and reduce our dependencies as a result of this, as the team's agile evangelist.

## Insights

At the ATO, I had the opportunity to work within many new subject areas that I wouldn't otherwise, given my background. As a User Experience degree is not heavily technology-focused, I have been able to polish and practice my development skills while learning to work and communicate in a large organisation spanning several offices and states. I have learnt many teamwork skills and have gained an understanding of not just how teams can work, but how organisations can work and grow in maturity. A major difference between university and the professional world was knowing and accepting that each team member is different and have their own expertise inside their domain - the challenging part is knowing how to make these disparate skills work together for a common goal, and knowing how to pave the path forward for each team member to flourish.
