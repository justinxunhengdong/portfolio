# Horizon Worlds: Survive
### A Metaverse Action Adventure Game

## Introduction
My first project at Playside Studios was _Survive_, a game developed and published by Meta for _Meta Horizons_, a metaverse / immersive world platform like _Roblox_ or _Fortnite_. I joined the project before a significant game pivot, and developed, refined and adapted the game's systems from develpoment to post-launch support. The game was originally a survival-crafting game for VR, but launched as a action-adventure RPG. Due to constantly shifting requirements, it was important to build solid, cheap systems and interactables that required a mix of interaction / UX design, systems design and technical design, which I was well suited for due to my previous experience. Additionally, the size and structure of the development team was a far cry from my experiences in small, lean teams, so it was also important to adapt my communication and documentation skills to match.

## Map Redesign

When we initially launched in early access, our data showed that the parkour sections were losing huge amounts of players. I redesigned these parts of the map, while also needing to balance an unproven pipeline, ambitious changes, strict polygon counts, and a regular update cadence. Level design was a discipline which the rest of the design team had limited experience, so I took the initiative to push and convince other deveopers of the issues I saw. 

We knew from our data that the parkour sections were huge drop-off points, and solved many interesting design problems, including:

_The original spire lacked identity and grandiosity, and stuck out visually._

_The new spire had a more enticing layout and stronger visual theming._  

* De-emphasising parkour -> I focused levels around traversal and exploration challenges rather than skill,
* Increasing map cohesion -> using a similar shape language and size to non-parkour areas,
* Improving theming -> working collaboratively with the art team - previously, textureless blockouts were interpreted separately by the art team.
* Improving pipeline and iteration speeds -> I used both Unity and Horizon Worlds, 
* Communicating entity positions and dependencies -> I developed a detailed map that could be referenced by other departments, minimising design integration errors,

_The cove and waterfall areas were a significant a collaborative effort from both designers and artists._

The resulting map changes were a huge improvement to the game, which was reflected in our data and heatmap. Crucially, it also gave me the experience and trust I needed on my next project (_Horizon Worlds: Smash Golf_), for which I led the level design.

## Other Responsibilities

Along with the map design, I also owned:
* The economy spreadsheet, and designed the algorithms for generating and simulating weapon, player and enemy stats, while keeping them in a readable and editable format for rapid iteration,
* Combat design, working with a gameplay programmer to improve game feel and control,
* UX design, working with UI designers on the player menu, build system, tutorials and FTUE,
* Visual and interaction design of virtual objects, minimising UI in favour for elegant visual communication,


## Insights
On Survive, I not only had to drive the quality of many of its core systems, but also learn how to adapt to different team dynamics, upskill other team members, and improve design processes. Most crucially, the experiencse I most valued from this project were the soft skills - improving and streamlining documentation, assessing risks, negotiating and managing scope, communicating intent, getting design buy-in, and collaborating with other disciplines.
