## Synopsis

_At the Edge of the West_ is a tabletop roleplaying game that I created, and was an attempt to combine elements from traditional tabletop roleplaying games, such as _Dungeons and Dragons_, _Shadowrun_ or _Cyberpunk_ with video game RPGs such as _Fallout_ and _Diablo_ and social deduction games such as _Bang!_ and _Exploding Kittens_. I decided to create this project not only to practice my design skills and play with my friends, but to rapidly iterate design decisions and to work on a project with a far larger scope than if I decided to create this RPG as a video game.

## Design

_I used Excel to balance how rare each card was to be. The game is designed around at least four players, who are expected to trade cards after a combat sequence._

The game's central gameplay theme revolves around tension, as I wanted to emulate the feeling of a Mexican standoff. As many westerns end in either standoff or betrayal, I designed the game around cards and roles - each player is given an _Agenda_ to fulfil by the end of the campaign (such as figuring out the other roles, killing or protecting a specific player), which is intended to provide just enough tension such that players are unwilling to trust each other. The distrust between players is also sowed through elements such as cards (players are given cards for their weapons) and physical poker chips or paper money. Distrust is also created between the players and the Dungeon Master, as hidden stats such as Terror (which describes the morale of an opposing party) and Reputation (which is a descriptor of overall party alignment and affects Terror rout actions) provide unexpected consequences to player actions. This ultimately leads the players to play the game not only as their characters, but as themselves, as they try to figure out each others' intentions. The use of these systems ultimately leads the game closer to "coopertition", which I brought into other projects such as _Rickety Spaceship Simulator_ and _Crimey Boyz_.

## Development

_I used interface design techniques to design the different types of cards, and created them in Adobe Illustrator._


For this game, I wrote all of the rules from the ground up, using the _GURPS_ model as a main point of influence, though I later took more inspiration from a variety of other sources. This was a gargantuan task, as I had to define the many rules and roles while keeping the game accessible. This included defining combat mechanics, dice probability distributions and accuracy tables for each individual weapon. I also developed the art and descriptions for all ~200 unique cards, all of which had to work on both gameplay and narrative fronts. I am also constantly iterating its design; more recently, I've changed the skill system to be more understandable, and am in the process of adding skill trees and additional mechanics, as well as modelling and 3D printing my own miniatures.

## Insights

I found that the development of this game had much overlap with both my user experience and game development work. In a tabletop game, there are many considerations that have to be made when compared to a video game, such as game speed, complexity of calculations, transparency of game mechanics, and social dynamics. I also learnt to fail fast - in the first game session, I had to boost player speed and weapon range by around five units, as it very quickly became apparent that combat scenarios would be far too slow.
