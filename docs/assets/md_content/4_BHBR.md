## Introduction
Better Habits Battle Royale (BHBR) was a prototype social mobile application created for a third-year Social Mobile Computing course, that aims to use the framing of competition among its users to encourage prolonged behaviour change. To do this, research was conducted into subjects such as motivation and self-determination theory, honesty and accountability, message framing and digital atmospheres.

## Design
Better Habits Battle Royale was initially named Bad Habits Battle Royale, and was an application that aimed to target benign bad habits, such as picking one's nose. User research was conducted by sending cultural probes to users, which took the form of a small "habit reporting booklet". Through our findings in the cultural probes, as well as through further research conducted into the topic, we found that the application was far more effective if messages were positively framed. This insight drew some very interesting questions into the relationships created between application and user, as well as how subtle changes in an application's design can drastically affect user behaviour.

## Development

As this project was extremely design-heavy, I conducted academic research that led to the design of several of its features, as well as analysed both the research and cultural probes to distill them into design insights. Among the features and interactions that I designed included a friending system that allowed users to opt-in to identificatio and the interaction flows of joining, creating and playing a battle. I also contributed to the project's click-through prototype and interface design, and defined the art style and design patterns used in the application. This marked my first foray into using Adobe XD.

## Insights

I found this project extremely fascinating, as it led me to become aware of how a user's affective state can be manipulated through their relationship with an application. This led me to reflect on the relationships curated between applications and games that I use, and taught me a lot about designing for mobile technology.
