_The trailer for Cursed Underworld._

I had the opportunity to contribute to the development of Len's Island at Brisbane-based Flow Studio as a game designer on Len's Island. Len's Island is a game that mixes open-world exploration, Diablo-style dungeon crawling and procedural generation, and Minecraft-like survival crafting economy. Given my experience and interest in open-world level design, systems-driven games and role-playing games, I was able to develop and drive multiple tentpole features that evolved the gameplay direction,  storytelling, systems depth and player engagement through the Cursed Underworld update.

## Cursed Underworld
I was involved in the development of Cursed Underworld, a large update that included major overhauls to existing content, as well as new content to prepare for the next narrative update of the game. I worked closely with the lead developer, art and programming departments to take several significant features from conception to release.

I was also involved in the game's UX and interaction design, designing, driving inventory and interface changes, while maintaining the strong visual identity and aesthetic of the existing game, as well as being a stakeholder for controller support - the game uses MOBA-like controls and is designed around mouse and keyboard, so many small tweaks and changes had to be made to the game's interaction design and language to make this work.

### Cursed Dungeons

_An environment I worked on as part of this update. Aesthetic beauty is a core tenet of Len's Island and I had to quickly adapt to being a level artist and maintaining a high level of technical polish._

The Cursed Dungeons feature started out as a way to reward high-level players with a difficult challenge, but grew to include major overhauls to the structure and context of each of the 8 levels, as well as adjusting them to work with new systems.

_An example of dungeon changes made before and after the Cursed Underworld update._

This included reworking environments and layouts to be more tightly paced and linear, adjusting level layouts to account for multiple runs and escape sequences through alternate paths, and designing encounters to play off the new systems and mechanics in the update, such as elite enemies, elemental protection, enchantments, builds, and ranged enemies.

The results of this included the development of multiple new walled encounters that would serve as friction points and setpieces for players, allowing players to approach encounters from multiple angles, and adding solves for fights, such as using cover, understanding the environment, and exploiting enemy pathfinding. As a result, dungeons became much more replayable, consistent and focused as a mechanic.

### Procedural caves

_The procedural cave system was a tentpole feature of the Cursed Update, adding an entirely new mode of play, and acting as a new core pillar of the game._

The procedural cave feature was an expansion of the learnings of the development of the game's ocean currents, an algorithm that would generate highways across the game's ocean, rewarding familiarity with the game's procedurally generated world. The procedural cave system would mirror the game's overworld, which consisted of various hand-built tiles placed in a random order based on a seed and algorithm.

_The procedural cave cells had to adhere to a series of strict guidelines, while maintaining the illusion of a single, seamless cave network._

I worked with the lead developer to design, prototype and set-dress around 50 unique cave tiles that could be duplicated rotated in multiple directions, which was difficult due to the fixed, isometric camera of the game, and could maintain an illusion of visual seamlessness and variety, as there were around 120 cave cells that had to be populated with the 50 cave tiles.

_Cave entries served the function of navigational landmarks and acted as environmental and gameplay vignettes._

I also designed challenges and mechanics that would work with this system - such as bridges that could only be repaired with resources from the overworld or building challenges that would sap the player's resources and pace out the exploration of the caves. These mechanics were an effort to provide increased resource specificity, and was influenced by Stardew Valley's cave system and Tears of the Kingdom's underground, which allow for a broader range of gameplay activities and rich gameplay dynamics.

While defining an entirely new gameplay language for Len's Island was difficult and a unique challenge, the final result was extremely well received by our playerbase, and improved the core gameplay of Len's Island significantly.

### Enchantments

I pitched and prototyped the game's Enchantments feature, which greatly expanded the game's buildcrafting and power progression elements. Enchantments allow player to stack status effects on tools and weapons, which would stack and multiply on top of each other in a manner similar to roguelikes Archero and Hades. This also led to the development of a status effect system that would allow game entities to communicate more intelligently, allowing for interactions such as fire propogation, trees knocking down other trees, stealing health from enemies, or making them explode on death, modifying the game's direction to have more emergent systems and deeper consequences.

_Armor was also added in this update, and added the foundation for expanded player builds._

When combined with the game's armor system and careful pacing of the game's rewards and progression, the enchantment system rewarded the players for exploring the map, gave them stronger relationships with their character, and gave the game a level of exploitability and self-expression that empowered players and provided a new progression vector for the game.

## Reflection
The Cursed Underworld update stands as one of my proudest achievements as a game designer, and my experience working at Flow Studio was invaluable for me in my personal and professional growth and development. I was grateful that I could bring my own spin and have a key hand in expanding the game in a bolder and more exciting direction.
