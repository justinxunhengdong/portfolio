### Synopsis
Crimey Boyz is a multiplayer game designed and developed for my final-year capstone project. The client was a UQ tutor who wanted a game that could collect data on player behaviour in asymmetric multiplayer games, and, given my experience analysing and developing asymmetric multiplayer in _Rickety Spaceship Simulator_, my team was selected to design and develop such a game. While we were given a design from the course's previous semester (the design given was titled _Slimey Boyz_), we decided to throw most of it out to create a more elegant design. 

The project also included a web interface and the storing of in-game actions to a database, and I was personally one of three members who worked exclusively on the game. The game was played on a PC and tablet, and used the third-party MLAPI (Mid-level API) to render the game synchronously on the tablet and PC.

The game's premise revolves around five hapless aliens robbing a bank by getting the moneybag from one side of the level to the other. If a player manages to get into the elevator to the next floor, they are able to lock other players out. The player who enters the elevator with the moneybag can choose who to share the money with, and the last player in the elevator becomes "Mission Control", a role that can help or hinder the other players by placing platforms in the scene.

## Design
I designed many of the game's mechanics along with another team member, who I worked with in _Rickety Spaceship Simulator_. The main conceit of the game's design revolved around using the emotions generated by the losing player as well as the imbalance of power between _Mission Control_ and the other players. In keeping with much of my work, I also paid a close eye towards game pacing and tension - this was the basis of the elevator mechanic, which served as an emotional climax to each level as well as a microcosm of the selfish or altrusitic behaviours seen during the level. In addition to the elevator, I also pitched the moneybag mechanic, which was created to draw focus to a given player - I was influenced by a similar mechanic in _Super Mario 3D World_, one of my favourite games.

Besides this, I also helped design the scoring system and much of the game's UI and interactions, such as the logon system, tablet interface and game interface, by conducting moderated usability walkthroughs and analyses.

## Development
During development, I was heavily involved with gameplay programming, and programmed the interactions for most of the environmental objects in the game, including the platform spawning, moneybag mechanics, UI for both the tablet and console views, level design and camera programming. I also used my technical art knowledge to implement Unity's Lightweight Render Pipeline, which allowed for the use of 2D lighting and normal maps, and helped optimise the game for a low-end 2017 tablet by reducing the amount of draw calls in the scene. I developed almost all the environmental art used in the game.

_The game made use of Unity's Lightweight Render Pipeline for its advanced lighting effects._

My other contributions included leading the team, using my skills developing in Scrum to keep the team organised, acting as the game's product owner as well as secondary Scrum master with writing acceptance criteria, test cases. I also led the art design, which had a "space Art Deco" theme, due to my love of _Bioshock_.


## Insights
Our game was highly successful during its exhibit, and came second in the People's Choice awards. However, its development was met with its setbacks, mostly due to overscoping, dependencies and the division of work between the game, website and networking components. We were additionally marred by the large initial scope of the project (which was effectively two-three projects worth of work), as well as the decision to design the project from scratch (teams were given a project designed by a previous team). Ultimately, we were able to organise around blockers and dependencies in order to demo the product in time.
