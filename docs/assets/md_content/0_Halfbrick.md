# Halfbrick Studios
### Designing for the fast-paced mobile market

## Introduction

I worked briefly at Australia's prolific Halfbrick Studios, where I joined as a graduate designer. During this time, I faced and overcame many struggles, and learnt my own strengths and weaknesses as a designer. This was a particular challenge for me as someone who had only done hobbyist work as an independent designer, apart from some university projects rooted in academia - I had to rapidly change my entire design process from one rooted in the structured problem domains of User Experience, to the fast paced and highly ambiguous world of mobile game development.

## Design

As a graduate designer, I was placed in a graduate team as the sole designer, with two programmers and later on, an artist. We began by building various prototypes suited for the casual and hypercasual markets, and then grew our skills by breaking down, recreating, then evolving a midcore arcade game. Following this, the game's direction pivoted to take a hybrid casual approach, and we pivoted the entire arcade core of the game within 4 weeks. During this time I was able to practice areas outside of core game design, such as systems, progression, economy and monetisation. I also learned much about my own design process, and where and how the designer works within an game development team.

## Development

I was able to practice and refine many areas outside of game design, such as my communication, teamwork and documentation skills. I also learnt how to use Google Sheets in detail, using AppScript for simple custom functions for economy and metaprogression design. I also was my team's scrum master, administrating the team's board through Miro, Jira and Trello, finding and refining our task management and keeping the team on track and on time.

## Insights

My experience at Halfbrick was definitely invaluable - I definitely joined as a very naive designer, and learnt quickly that the design process exists for a reason. I also learnt to create my own frameworks and checks to ensure I don't lose focus, which is particularly easy to do in game development. The importance of validation is also something I learnt - as there is a comparative lack of best practices compared to UX, and games are extremely subjective based on the tastes of the player, figuring out ways to test, validate and iterate designs quickly is of paramount importance to the game development process.
The mobile market as a whole is also driven through KPIs, analytics, metrics and trends, and I was able to practice and adapt existing skills to various unknown genres and areas. As a result, my work here was always interesting, feeling like I was crossing a new frontier every day - at the end of the day, that's what I love about game development.
